# Data Science/AI/ML/DL learning notes

A year ago I learned Deep Learning from several MOOCs.
Now I plan to dive deeper and doing experiments, listening different random
lectures and taking notes.

This repository contains(will contain) random notes about related topic.

There is no order based on difficulty or dependency between the topics.
Everything is random. So do not rely on my notes too much. :-D
