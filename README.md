# Data Science/AI/ML/DL learning notes

A year ago I learned basics of Deep Learning from several MOOCs. Now I plan to dive deeper by doing experiments while listening to different random lectures. In this repository, I will keep my lecture-notes.

There is no order based on difficulty or dependency between the topics. Everything is random. So please do not rely on my notes too much. :-D
